              Hi there, my name is Hristina, I'm 27 and I love cats! :3
            </p>
            <p>
              My origins are from North Macedonia, but for the last 4 years
              I've made a new home in Germany, in the cozy city of Freiburg.
              I'm a curious person by nature and love to learn about varieties
              of topics, but in particular I developed a passion for computers
              and how they work. You can find me frequently spending my nights
              tinkering with my linux system, changing keybindings of my tiling
              window manager (i3) or obsessively designing the polybar to sit
              juuuust right.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I dwelled deeper, I've decided to work towards the goal of
              transforming that passion into a profession, with the hope that I
              will find opportunities which will allow me to learn more and use
              that knowledge practically.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a display of my ongoing efforts, you can find my contact
              information in the following Javascript object:<br/>

            Don't let that title fool you!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm still fairly new at programming. But, I've managed to do few things: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                    build a website from scratch with HTML, CSS and JS</strong> 
                    using online tutorials.
              If you want to check out the code, just head to the buttons down
              below, where you can check the code as an image, or the github repository.<br/>
              <button id="HTML" class="modal_button">
                <img src="./images/logo_html.png" class="inline-img"/> Check HTML
              </button>
              <button id="CSS" class="modal_button">
                <img src="./images/logo_css.png" class="inline-img"/> Check CSS
              </button>
              <button id="JS" class="modal_button">
                <img src="./images/logo_js.png" class="inline-img"/> Check Javascript
              </button>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>set up a virtual private server using ssh and nginx.</strong>
              The server supports HTTPS thanks to the kind people from LetsEncrypt and
              is setup to renew the certificate automatically, using a cronjob that
              periodically runs the certbot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>set up a GitHub repository for the website</strong>
              and learned the basics of Git.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>started using Linux with a focus on the command line.</strong>
                got familiar with GRUB2, started using the i3wm with specific
                keybindings, also trying to avoid using the mouse
                (semi-successful try). 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="column">
            <p>
            With regards to the operating system on the old laptop I was using,
            changing to Linux was an awesome experience, since that laptop had a
            CPU speed of [....] and running Windows on it made it extremely slow.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a beginner, I started with Ubuntu, but still didn't quite liked
            it, due to the many unnecessary pre-installed programs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Researching through the many open-source OS, I landed on Debian which offered 
            higher security and had a great manual on it's website of how to set it up yourself. 
            </p>
            <p>
            But, that still hasn't satisfied me fully, because again, it came with 
            pre-installed programs that I didn't needed.
            </p>
            <p>
            Soon after, Arch Linux came into existence on my computer. It is
            highly configurable, with only the minimum required programs, has a
            great community of people who devote their time to maintain it and
            security-wise is up-to-date.  
            </p>
            <p>
