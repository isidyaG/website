              Hi there, my name is Hristina, I'm 27 and I love cats and dogs! :3
            </p>
            <p>
              My origins are from North Macedonia, but for the last 3 years
              I've made a new home in Germany, in the cozy city of Freiburg.
              I'm a curious person by nature and love to learn about varieties
              of topics, but in particular I developed a passion for computers
              and how they work. You can find me frequently spending my nights
              tinkering with my linux system, changing keybindings of my tiling
              window manager (i3) or obsessively designing the polybar to sit
              juuuust right.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I dwelled deeper, I've decided to work towards the goal of
              transforming that passion into a profession, with the hope that I
              will find opportunities which will allow me to learn more and use
              that knowledge practically. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As a display of my ongoing efforts, you can find my contact
              information in the following Javascript object: <button id="block-code">Click me!</button><br/>

          <p>
            Don't let that title fool you!
          </p>
            I'm still fairly new at programming, but I've managed to do few things: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> build a website from scratch with HTML, CSS and JS</strong>
              using online tutorials. If you want to check out the code, just head to the buttons down
              below, where you can check the code as an image, or the github repository.<br/>
              <button id="HTML" class="modal_button">
                <img src="./images/logo_html.webp" width="9" height="13" class="inline-img" alt="logo-html"/> Check HTML
              </button>
              <button id="CSS" class="modal_button">
                <img src="./images/logo_css.webp" width="9" height="13" class="inline-img" alt="logo-html"/> Check CSS
              </button>
              <button id="JS" class="modal_button">
                <img src="./images/logo_js.webp" width="9" height="13" class="inline-img" alt="logo-html"/> Check Javascript
              </button>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>set up a virtual private server using ssh and nginx.</strong>
              The server supports HTTPS thanks to the kind people from LetsEncrypt and
              is setup to renew the certificate automatically, using a cronjob that
              periodically runs the certbot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>set up a GitHub repository for the website</strong>
              and learned the basics of Git.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>started using Linux with a focus on the command line.</strong> 
              My journey as a beginner started from Ubuntu, but then went over
              Debian to Arch Linux, since I wanted to know how the things worked
              underneath. That brought me into contact with the following things:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>bash</strong> - got comfortable using the terminal, my favourite 
                  tools of choice are <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://www.vim.org/" aria-label="Find more about Vim">vim</a> 
                  as a text editor and <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://ranger.github.io/" aria-label="Find more about Ranger">ranger</a> 
                  as a file browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>GRUB2</strong> - I don't know much about it, but once I
                  forgot my root password and managed to boot into a root shell by
                  editing the GRUB menu entry and changed the password with the
                  passwd command. ;)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>package-manager</strong> - I got familiar with the
                  concept of package managers, in particular with apt, pacman and
                  yay. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>systemd</strong> - understood the main purpose of systemd as a service manager.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>custom desktop environment</strong>  - got obsessed with
                  designing my own desktop environment using <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://i3wm.org/" aria-label="Find more about i3wm">i3wm</a> 
                  as a tiling window manager, <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://github.com/yshui/picom" aria-label="Find more about picom">picom</a> 
                  as compositor, <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://polybar.github.io/" aria-label="Find more about Polybar">polybar</a> as a status-bar,

          Since it's my first website and I am pretty excited about it, I wonder
          if it would make sense to add maybe a parallel vertical section to the 
          Blog-post mentioning favorite books, movies, series, art.. or is it lame?
          I cannot decide myself. However, at least, I could try.. :D

          Okay, got it. Time to restructure the website, decide for the design
          and commit to the repository. Note to self: always check the git
          status.

          Added more content, but to be able to access it easier, there has to
          be a menu! Just give me a bit of time and the menu will work! :)

          what to write..<br/>First, I should probably start with the overall content.
